## How does art influence you? 

I would say that Art is a way of understanding a world in a form of creativity. Any form of art attracts a specific person based on them, their likings, their way to be of something. No one just likes art because it is art but because of the feeling they evoke in you, maybe the relatability to the author or the emotions they provoke or the messages it conveys. It is what defines our personality in a way. With that said, art influences me because it helps me bring out a creative side of my world in a way that I can portray myself while being relatable to an author or the feelings of said art. It gives me a view on another perception, which has an impact on my personality from seeing what I, from my point of view couldn't see.
 It is another form of communication, emotionally than logically.
